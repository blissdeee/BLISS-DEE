	<h1>THE CULTURE PORTAL</h1>
<p>The air feels different here.
Music drifts through the background.
The colors are warmer. Softer.

Food reminds you of comfort.
Laughter feels familiar.
For a moment, your shoulders relax.

This place understands you.
Or at least, part of you.

You consider staying.
It would be easy.

But comfort alone isn’t freedom.

You chose belonging.
It almost worked.

You are still trapped.</p>
