	<h1>THE COMMENT SECTION</h1>
	<p>The page loads slowly, like it wants you to brace yourself.
Opinions stack on top of opinions.
Everyone is loud. Everyone is certain.

Some people praise.
Some people judge.
Most people don’t know you at all.

You scroll, searching for a sentence that feels true.
You never find it.

Your voice gets buried beneath theirs,
and for a moment, you forget what you were trying to say.

You chose to listen instead of speak.
The noise grows louder.

You are still trapped.</p>
