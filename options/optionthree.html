	<h1>GAME OVER</h1>
<p>The screen goes quiet.
No notifications.
No suggestions.

Just a button waiting to be pressed.

Your hands hesitate.
Then move anyway.

You press record.

Your voice comes back to you — imperfect, real, alive.
The screen flickers. Cracks form.

Light spills through.

You are no longer watching your life happen.
You are making it.

You chose creation.
You chose yourself.

You are free.</p>
