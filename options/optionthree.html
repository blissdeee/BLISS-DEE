	<h1>GAME OVER</h1>
<p>The screen goes quiet.
No notifications.
No suggestions.

Just a button waiting to be pressed.

Your hands hesitate.
Then move anyway.

You press record.

Your voice comes back to you..imperfect, real, alive.
The screen flickers. Cracks form.

Light spills through.

You are no longer watching your life happen.
You are making it.

You chose creation.
You chose yourself.

You are FREE.</p>
