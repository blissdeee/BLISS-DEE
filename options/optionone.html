	<h1>THE ENDLESS SCROLL</h1>
<p>You tell yourself it will only take a second.
One video. One post. One more refresh.

Your thumb moves without asking you.
Faces blur together. Sounds overlap.
Nothing stays long enough to matter.

Minutes turn into hours.
Hours disappear completely.

The screen never ends, and neither does the feeling
that you are waiting for something that never comes.

You chose to keep scrolling.
The algorithm smiles.

You are still trapped.</p>
